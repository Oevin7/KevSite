            &emsp;This will be my first of many rants I'm sure. Just to be more concise I will break up these paragraphs. In
            no particular order tho lol. College is something I am new to. So far it sucks. I can't believe anyone wants
            to go sometimes lol. Though I do understand college can be good. It does have benefits. I just don't believe
            it is for me.
        </p>

        <p>
            &emsp;Currently, I am taking trying to go for a Computer Science degree. I love computers and programming (I
            probably talked all about it in the about me lol), but so far I have barely learned anything related to CS.
            I am doing college algebra... not fun (so annoying. I hate it so much lol). I am also taking college writing
            and speech. I don't mind the latter that much since I do really like the teacher. However, it still sucks.
            Due to my ASD/ADHD I have a ton of trouble finding motivation to even do these assignments. It is waning with
            each waking day honestly.
        </p>

        <p>
            &emsp;I have a math final tomorrow and the project is due the same day. That is so ridiculous to me. Why is it due
            on the same day? Why am I paying to be stressed out. I'm technically not paying due to the job corps program,
            but despite that I still would have had to if I did not join them. I have my own gripes with them that won't
            be included here. I just can't take all these assignments. I am barely making it through them. Then, when I do,
            I forget everything!! I am cramming for the test... not learning. I don't know why anyone considers this
            learning.
        </p>

        <p>
            &emsp;I just want to focus on what I truly enjoy, programming. I know a lot of people say I won't be able to do
            that in the real world, and I have some gripes with that statement. First, in a job setting I would be
            getting paid to do what I don't want to do lol. That makes it a little more tolerable. Secondly, I should
            be able to focus on what I care for. I try to tell people all the time that they would receive more
            productive results if they'd let me focus on what I want/sort of need to focus on. I am miserable in college,
            and the fact that it has barely pertained to what I want to do makes it more annoying.
        </p>

        <p>
            &emsp;On top of that, I barely even have time to focus on what I want to do! I've learned more using the internet
            than I have in college. Everyone says you just have to wait to get to those classes... WHY? I am literally
            paying these places to teach me this information. The worst part is the required classes are not free. If
            you are going to make me take a class, I should NOT have to pay for it. It just irritates me to no end. My
            school isn't even that bad in that regard. My friend literally has no time to do anything. Why should college
            get to take all the time I should have to me. I get it college is similar to a "job". It just annoys me that
            I have to pay to have my time seemingly wasted, just to get a degree that in all honesty, I shouldn't even
            need. It is just so annoying, and I am so bothered by it.
        </p>

        <p>
            &emsp;Now with all this said, I don't want to come across as telling people they should not go. I mean as it stands
            I would sort of agree with that. However, some jobs SHOULD require a degree. They need advanced knowledge
            that can't just be learned through training. However, most places don't need this. Those degree requirements
            should be dropped. Also, some people will enjoy college! To those folks, please go! Have fun and enjoy life!
            That's all I really want to share with people. I just want people to live the life they want. I just don't
            feel happy with what I am doing, and I really hate the college life. It just sucks and isn't for me. Anyway,
            that was my first rant, and I am sure I will put more on here. I usually have a lot to say, and I want
            somewhere special to put it. I figured why not make a cool site to rant and just overall show off some
            skills lol. Anyway I hope you enjoyed reading. Have a great day! :)
